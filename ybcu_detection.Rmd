## History

This model is a general additive model like the one done in 2018 by John Stanek and Shannon McNeil.  That modeling effort settled on model R4 for the final report.  I presume this was done since it was closest to what was promised and made the point that year since restoration is very important.

The best model according to John, pre-2019 was model R10.  

glmer(COBPRB ~ ha + Age + nAges +(1|Site) +(1|Year), data = det, family = poisson)

The other closest 3 (according to AIC) had nAges in them and various other factors that are related to the surrounding contiguous area. These are probably highly correlated with nAges.

I suspect that R4 was settled on since the other variables explain variance in detection because they are represent stand age in adjacent areas, and therefor don't add much to the point that stand age matters.

## Matching up 2019-2022 data to older data

Cari Lynn developed this table to relate MSCP Section numbers to sites used in previous analyses.

The Trans19_sub is the data for just the SiteCodes in the 2018 analysis.  It gives a list of SurveyKeys that could be used to summarize data from pt19, pt20, pt21, and pt22.

## Modeling detections

Since we did not count territories, I checked to see if svdets and COBPRB are correlated and they are highly correlated(r = 0.92).  If we want to predict territories from stand age, we can use the regression from the pre-2019 data.

```{r detections}
plot(detAll$svdets, detAll$COBPRB)
cor.test(detAll$svdets, detAll$COBPRB)
detTerr.lm = lm(detAll$COBPRB~detAll$svdets)
summary(detTerr.lm)
abline(detTerr.lm)
# predictions between 1-102
detTerr.lm.pred = predict(detTerr.lm)

plot((detAll$svdets / detAll$ha), detAll$COBPRB)
cor.test((detAll$svdets / detAll$ha), detAll$COBPRB)
dphTerr.lm = lm(detAll$COBPRB~(detAll$svdets / detAll$ha))
summary(dphTerr.lm)
abline(dphTerr.lm)
# predictions between 1-102
dphTerr.lm.pred = predict(dphTerr.lm)

## Rerescaling of cha2 variable leads to exact same results and removes warnings,
#     but rescaling adds difficulty in interpreting results, analyzed as w/o rescaling as the results are the same either way
# I think I have some other version of the scale command loaded
# detAll$cha3 = scale(detAll$cha2)
# detAll$cha3 = (detAll$cha2 - mean(detAll$cha2)) / sd(detAll$cha2)
detAll$ha1 = (detAll$ha - mean(detAll$ha)) / sd(detAll$ha)
