#LCR YBCU data crunching

This folder was created to work with YBCU data if R would be a better to get all the data from 2008-22 in one place.

I have also set up dBeaver to view all databases and .csv files.  It might be easiest to create a view that combines the right tables across years and then bring that into R to do occupancy modeling.
